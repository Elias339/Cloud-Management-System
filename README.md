# Cloud Server Management

I selected Track C (Full-stack) to showcase my proficiency in managing both backend API development and frontend user interface implementation in a cohesive manner. Undertaking the full-stack development allowed me to demonstrate the ability to design, integrate, and deliver a complete, functional application from end to end.

## Features

- **User Authentication** - Secure login with token-based sessions  
- **Server Management** - Full CRUD operations for cloud servers  
- **Advanced Filtering** - Filter by provider, status, CPU, RAM, and search  
- **Bulk Operations** - Select and delete multiple servers  
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices  
- **Real-time Validation** - Form validation with user feedback  
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control** - Versioning to prevent update conflicts

## Authentication Endpoints

# Login
URL: POST /api/login
Body:
{
  "email": "admin@gmail.com",
  "password": "password"
}

# Logout
URL: POST /api/logout
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}

## Server Endpoints

# List Servers
URL: GET /api/servers
Query Parameters: page, per_page, sort, order, q, provider, status, min_cpu, max_cpu

# Create Server
URL: POST /api/servers
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
Body:
{
  "name": "Server Name",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "provider": "aws",
  "status": "active",
  "cpu_cores": 4,
  "ram_mb": 8192,
  "storage_gb": 100
}

# Get Server Details
URL: GET /api/servers/{id}
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Update Server
URL: PUT /api/servers/{id}
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
Body: Same as create plus optional version field for optimistic concurrency

# Delete Server
URL: DELETE /api/servers/{id}
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Bulk Delete
URL: POST /api/servers/bulk-delete
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
Body:
{
  "ids": [1, 2, 3]
}

## üì± UI Overview

## üêõ Debugging Journey

CORS Configuration: Fixed frontend API access by configuring Laravel CORS middleware

Authentication Token Management: Implemented sessionStorage with cross-tab synchronization

Optimistic Concurrency Control: Version mismatch errors fixed with backend checks

Bulk Delete Implementation: Used database transactions for atomic operations

Responsive Table Design: Horizontal scrolling and Bootstrap utilities to fix overflow

## ‚öñÔ∏è Tech Decisions & Trade-offs

Laravel Sanctum - Lightweight token-based auth, trade-off: fewer features than Passport

React Hook Form - Less re-rendering, trade-off: additional dependency

Bootstrap UI - Rapid development, trade-off: less unique design

Client-side Filtering & Pagination - Faster UX, trade-off: limited to loaded data

Optimistic Concurrency Control - Prevents accidental overwrite, trade-off: adds complexity
